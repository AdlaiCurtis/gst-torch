Not only are the networks CUDA-enabled, but the pipeline has also been accelerated with CUDA tensors.

Source for [Monocular Depth](src/monodepth.rs)

Depends on CUDA-enabled LibTorch:

- Get `libtorch` from the
[PyTorch website download section](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- Set env `${LIBTORCH}`

### Test with any of the following:
```
./test_dashboard_file.sh
./test_dashboard_preview.sh
./test_monodepth_preview.sh
```
